# Wave Function Collapse
This project makes use of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm to generate images that could be used for various different applications. But is mainly aimed at usage for maps within games or alike.

# Goal 
The goal of this project is to get a better understanding of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm while making it usable for real-world use cases. This project is more focused on delivering results and easy to use, rather than being fast or compact. 

# How to use
Within the Precomp.hpp file, make sure to adjust the defined parameters to your liking. <br />
Once adjusted, simply run the project and it will display the result of the wave function collapse. <br />
By pressing the Enter key, the wave function collape will be restarted, giving you a new result.

Example of an image being used for input:
<br />

Example of a result of the input image from above:
![First iteration](/Assets/Github_Images/Sample.png)

# Road Map
- [X] Rework image importing
- [X] Add image sampling
- [X] Add pixel comparison constrain building
- [ ] Add CSV constrain building
- [ ] Rework WFC simple method to reflect on the new constrain system
- [ ] Add WFC overlapping method

# Other
This project is still being under developement, but due to time limitation, this might move slower than expected.
